				I worked with the maintenance team that is employed by the school. This involved me working with others to help 
				organise classrooms furniture and making sure they had adequate equipment. I moved items into storage and 
				maintained the schools cleanliness and efficiency whilst the school was running.This involved strenuous physical 
				activity and involved me working independently to ensure that tasks were completed swiftly and effectively whilst 
				also working as a member of a team at some points to lift objects too heavy for just one person. <br>
