				Personal Profile<br>
				A flexible and dynamic Business Computing student studying at the University of Northampton looking for employment 
				in only the best businesses and ventures, who wishes to utilise his skills and assets gained over the years at 
				various educational institutes and walks of life, to further the prestige and potential of the place of employment 
				and his own growth,<br>

				Over the course of my degree thus far, I have successfully Integrated my studies and my social life along with my 
				commitments to my society in an effective and well balanced approach. This has shown my capability to adapt to such 
				a pressure filled and ever changing environment whilst still remaining a clear logical thought process with a 
				practical and analytical approach to all the various problems I face on a daily basis. I have come to learn that I 
				enjoy the difficulties that come with such an environment, regardless of whether it is on my own, or working as part 
				of an effective team. In short, I believe myself to be trustworthy, hardworking and a fun individual to be around that 
				can prove a benefit to any working environment I find myself in and am eager to get out into the world of work and put 
				my skills to use.<br>
				<br>
				Personal Skills<br>
				Team Work, Team Leading, Task Delegation, Java, Python and HTML knowledge, Effective Communication, Timekeeping, Problem 
				Analysis and Resolution, Good Self Motivation, Computational Awareness, Creative. <br>
				All of these skills I feel I have as a person and have nurtured over my school and general life. Most were developed fully 
				in University when I started getting heavy into volunteering for my fellow students to run events and socials for them. 
				Often becoming a first point of contact for them should they want to run an event or get people involved in things. It was 
				here I developed an understanding of how to run things within a business culture within the Students Union and the 
				University itself. Iâ€™ve run many events for societies at the university now and all have run smoothly and effectively due 
				to my ability to work with my team members and to lead them effectively. <br>
				I also find that the course I am, Business Computing, has also developed these skills and nurtured other ones in me. Such 
				as the Technical knowledge I have gained of Computers and Business practice and regulations. I feel this greatly improves 
				my abilities to work and for people as a job might dictate. Being well versed in these practices now and knowing the 
				techniques required to do so effectively has improved my ability to work effectively in almost any environment.<br>
				<br>
				Personal Interests<br>
				I am very interested in video games, films, manga, comic books, anime, cartoons, TV and Internet culture.
