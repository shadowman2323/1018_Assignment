--- Design Choices ---
Layout 
	I chose a simple box based layout, with varying size boxes, as I felt this would be the easiest for the eye to follow and fully capture the 
	information I wanted to put on the pages. Personally I do believe it is a very simnple design, but I feel it is still effective, especially given
	my limited abilities when it comes to coding HTML.

Colours
	I chose the Grey colour scheme, utilising varying shades of grey, as I like the cold professional look it gives. I find that in a professional
	document such as a CV, a colder colour scheme would do me more benefit than a bright garish one. Especially given the industry I am looking to
	enter, a colder scheme is more apt i find.

Font 
Title 		- Bungee Shade
	I chose this font based on its in your face Pop. It is a loud font that tears the eyes to it, perfect for a title font. It draws the eyes to the
	relevant starting points for my page, and excites the reader with its exotic yet retro feel. Meaning that it makes for an effective guide, as 
	all titles should be.
	
Main Text 	- Droid Sans
	This font was chosen for the opposite reasons I chose the title font, it's an easy on the eye relatively plain font type, but it still compliments 
	the title font well whilst also being just a bit different from the normal main text fonts in use these days. It provides a nice off beat but still
	on the pulse look that I like to have on my cv.


--- References ---
	http://www.w3schools.com/ 
	I used w3schools to reference and check the syntax of a lot of my code. Given the depth of their tutorials i found it to be a very useful tool for 
	checking and adapting my code to fit current standards and ideals.
	
	Module resources available on NILE
	I used the lesson slides and tutorials to great length to expand and refine my knowledge of HTML and CSS. They were greatly helpful in walking me 
	through some parts I was struggling with, and thus became my first port of call for help.
	
	https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse326/02wi/homework/hw5/good-readmes.html
	I used this as a reference for how I should structure my README file, the actual content of this file comes from the checklist provided on NILE. 
	But seeing as I have never done a professional README file, i decided it was a good idea to get a look at some good examples.
	

--- Approximation of Hours ---
In total I'd say the whole project took about 10-12 hours to complete, check over and hand in. With the most work going into the documentation and 
justification of decisions made, and conforming to current standards. Without these, solid building would have been alot faster and less stressful, 
but ultimately the project would have been less impressive and more lackluster.
